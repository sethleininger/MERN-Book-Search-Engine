# MERN-Book-Search-Engine

## Description 
For this project I was given starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It was set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

In order for this application to use a GraphQL API, I refactored the API to use GraphQL on the back end and added some functionality to the front end. I was given specifications containing details about the files I needed to modify on the back end and the front end.

To complete this project, I did the following:

Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.

Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
